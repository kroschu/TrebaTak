NUSoptimeizer was ideated and hacked up in 24 hours during Hack&Roll 2016, with Kenneth Loh and Jamos Tay.

NUSoptimeizer aims to help optimise a NUS student's timetable by optimising for certain heuristics, including free days, number of breaks, day start/day end time and ease of transit between classes.
