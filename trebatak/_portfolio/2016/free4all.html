Free4All allows users to view and share locations within NUS (or other specified communities) that have freebie giveaways, such as buffet food or goodie bag giveaways. Free4All aims to help event organizers reduce waste by allowing them to give out unfinished food/items, or to attract others to their event by offering free stuff.

Built on Meteor, Free4All is updated in real-time, showing users the exact location and status of giveaways at any time.

Free4All was a submission for [Orbital 2016](http://orbital.comp.nus.edu.sg/), and the team consists of Leon Mak and myself.
