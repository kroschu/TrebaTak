In conjunction with ST Electronics, PatientVirtualAssistant aims to improve the lives of bedridden patients and their caretakers. With an iPad to be placed at the side of the patient's bed, the app will streamline the ordering of daily hospital meals, help patients and nurses overcome language barrier to communicate, and also display the patient's vital signs from IoT-enabled sensors attached to the patient or the bed, in real-time.

This was the final project submission for [CS3217 Software Engineering on Modern Application Platforms](https://www.facebook.com/cs3217/), taken in AY16/17 Semester 2.

The team includes:

- Louie Tan, backend developer
- Shen Yichen, backend developer
