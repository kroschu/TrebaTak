uPOS is a unified point-of-sales (POS) system commissioned by Fei Siong Group, which owns over 100 outlets in Singapore alone. The uPOS Management System is a web backend for the POS which are deployed in stores, and manages the items and other data that will be utilised by these POS machines.

For this, we built a RESTful API on top of Koa.js, which serves both the POS machines as well as the web backend simultaneously. The web backend is built in React and handles CRUD of menu items, outlets,  staff, and more.

Finally, we also built a report generator in PHP to generate reports in either CSV or PDF. These reports will be used for accounting purposes.
