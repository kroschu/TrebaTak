Trumpify is a Chrome extension built on the day of the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump, during the [Hack&Roll 2017](http://hacknroll.nushackers.org/) hackathon.

Trumpify is able to make your Facebook feed great again by doing the following:

1. Replace all your friends' profile pictures with that of Trump
2. Modify matching words and phrases with famous phrases used by Trump using a simple regex match
3. Uses facial recognition to add Trump's golden crown on faces in Facebook photos

The team includes Kent Nguyen, Leon Mak and me.
